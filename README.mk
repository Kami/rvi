NOTES
===
You need to download rc-conf-syntax-checker.py Python script (http://github.com/Kami/rc-conf-syntax-checker) and put it into your Python path (if you use FreeBSD and have Python 2.6 installed, putting it into the `/usr/local/lib/python2.6/` directory should work fine) for this program to work properly when editing the /etc/rc.conf file.
